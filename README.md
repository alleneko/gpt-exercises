This repo is for exercises on various languages and concepts given to me by chatgpt, and even a section where chatgpt is tasked with completing its own exercise. I may also include non-coding related exercises if it suits me. You will find the base prompt alongside an example in the [Prompts](#chatgpt-prompts) section.

I've been using chatgpt for a while, though I'm not very good at writing prompts, as I don't tend to focus on doing that when I use it since I usually get what I need from basic prompts of me complaining about something not working. This idea literally just hit me, why don't I ask it to give me exercises to gradually learn new languages and concepts. I was toying around with the idea of adding a whole EXP system to it, which I may try again at it later on. I also wanted to implement the memory feature, but I figured it wasn't really needed since I'll be designing it to build on the last project, which should be fresh enough for it to remember without a special memory system. If you want it to add to the memory just include it in the additional rules for now.

## Exercises

This repo currently has no exercises as it was just made. I will try to update it daily as exercises are completed. If I forget, oh well I guess.

Here is an example of this prompt. This is what I will be using when I ask for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
